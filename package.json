  "description": "ffmpegSlideshow simplifies the creation of visually engaging slideshows with seamless transitions from a collection of images. While ffmpeg's default capabilities allow for basic slideshow creation, it doesn't support transitions, making for a less smooth and less engaging experience. And while ffmpeg-concat provides transition capabilities, it requires a video input. ffmpegSlideshow bridges this gap by combining the strengths of these two libraries, providing an intuitive, simple-to-use wrapper. With ffmpegSlideshow, you can effortlessly convert a folder of images into a dynamic video slideshow, complete with customizable transitions.",
